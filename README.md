# PharmaDesk ERP ERP

A pharmacy management system built to digitize inventory, billing, purchases, and stock operations for small and medium-sized medical stores.

The project was developed after observing how many pharmacies still rely on handwritten registers for inventory tracking, purchase records, and billing. The goal was to build a practical ERP that addresses real operational problems such as batch tracking, expiry monitoring, GST-compliant billing, stock reconciliation, and auditability.

Unlike generic inventory systems, PharmaDesk ERP focuses on pharmacy-specific workflows including FEFO inventory handling, batch-wise stock management, multi-unit inventory conversion, and expiry-based stock monitoring.

## Development Context

The project originated from studying day-to-day workflows in a local medical store where inventory and purchase records were being maintained manually.

The system is being developed around actual pharmacy requirements rather than generic inventory assumptions. Inventory movement, batch tracking, GST calculations, expiry management, and reporting workflows were designed with real-world operational constraints in mind.

## Core Features

### Inventory Management

* Batch-wise inventory tracking
* Multi-unit stock management
* Product master management
* Inventory adjustments
* Stock valuation
* Low stock monitoring
* Reorder level tracking
* Product search and filtering

### Multi-Unit Inventory

Supports inventory conversion between:

* Box → Strip → Tablet
* Box → Capsule
* Bottle → ml
* Pack → Sachet

Examples:

* Purchase 1 strip containing 15 tablets
* Sell 2 tablets
* Inventory automatically updates remaining quantity

This prevents stock inaccuracies common in pharmacy environments.

### Batch Management

* Batch-wise stock tracking
* Manufacturing date tracking
* Expiry date tracking
* Batch-level inventory visibility
* Batch search
* Batch-specific reporting

### FEFO Inventory Logic

First Expiry First Out (FEFO) implementation.

When a medicine exists in multiple batches:

* The system automatically prioritizes the earliest valid expiry batch
* Older inventory is sold first
* Reduces expiry-related losses

### Billing & Sales

* GST-compliant billing
* Invoice generation
* Sales history
* Invoice search
* Invoice reprint
* Discount handling
* Multiple payment methods (cash, UPI, card, credit)
* Sales analytics

### Purchase Management

* Purchase entry
* Supplier management
* Purchase history
* Batch creation during purchase
* Automatic inventory updates
* Purchase reporting

### Expiry Monitoring

* Expired stock tracking
* 30-day alerts
* 60-day alerts
* 90-day alerts
* Expiry dashboards
* Expiry valuation reports

### GST Management

* HSN code support
* CGST calculations
* SGST calculations
* IGST calculations
* GST reporting
* Tax summaries
* GST-ready invoice generation

### Reporting

Inventory Reports

* Stock reports
* Inventory valuation
* Low stock reports
* Batch reports

Sales Reports

* Daily sales
* Weekly sales
* Monthly sales
* Product-wise reports

Purchase Reports

* Purchase summaries
* Supplier reports

GST Reports

* Tax collection summaries
* GST breakdown reports

### Data Export & Recovery

* Inventory CSV export
* Sales CSV export
* Purchase CSV export
* GST CSV export
* Customer CSV export
* Full backup generation

The philosophy is simple:

> Your business data should remain portable and accessible at all times.

## Technical Focus

Most pharmacy management demos focus heavily on dashboards and visual presentation.

This project focuses on operational correctness.

Primary engineering priorities:

* Batch-level inventory accuracy
* FEFO stock deduction
* GST calculation correctness
* Inventory reconciliation
* Multi-unit inventory conversion
* Expiry management
* Stock movement auditability
* Consistent reporting

A significant portion of development effort was spent on business logic, inventory consistency, and pharmacy-specific workflows rather than purely visual design.

## Security

Current security measures include:

* Role-based access control (owner / staff roles)
* Protected application routes via NextAuth middleware
* JWT session management (24-hour expiry)

* Input validation with Zod
* Audit-oriented inventory workflows

Future enhancements:

* Two-factor authentication
* Advanced audit logging
* Automated backup verification

## Project Goals

Building a pharmacy-focused ERP that handles the operational workflows a medical store actually runs on:

* Batch-wise stock deduction with FEFO ordering
* GST-compliant invoices with CGST/SGST/IGST breakdown
* Expiry monitoring across all active batches
* Purchase entry that creates/updates batches and adjusts inventory atomically
* Audit trail on every stock movement
* CSV exports so data is never locked in

Inventory correctness takes priority over dashboard aesthetics.

---

## Roadmap

Planned improvements:

* Barcode scanning
* QR code support
* Android application
* WhatsApp invoice sharing
* Advanced reporting
* Prescription management
* Customer credit tracking
* Supplier analytics
* Inventory forecasting
* Automated reorder recommendations
